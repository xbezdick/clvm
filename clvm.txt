LVM
LVM adds fast and reliable abstraction layer on top of classical partitions. Logical Volume Management provides a means to concatenate, stripe together or otherwise combine partitions into larger virtual ones that administrators can re-size or move, potentially without interrupting system use. Logical partitions aren't limited to size of physical discs. LVM also allows mirroring and snapshots.
